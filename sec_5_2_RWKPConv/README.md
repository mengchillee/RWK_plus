To run the codes, just simply use the following commands:

`python -m train.nc`

`python -m train.bot`

`python -m train.zinc`

`python -m train.molhiv`

`python -m train.molpcba`

All the datasets will be downloaded automatically when running the codes except TwiBot-22.
TwiBot-22 is public but needs the approval from the authors.
Use the following command to preprocess the Twitter data into a graph:

 `python data/TwiBot-22/preprocess.py`
